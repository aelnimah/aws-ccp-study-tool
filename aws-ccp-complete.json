      "question": "You have set up consolidated billing for several AWS accounts. One of the accounts has purchased a number of reserved instances for 3 years. Which of the following is true regarding this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "The Reserved Instance discounts can only be shared with the master account.",
        "All accounts can receive the hourly cost benefit of the Reserved Instances.",
        "The purchased instances will have better performance than On-demand instances.",
        "There are no cost benefits from using consolidated billing; It is for informational purposes only."
      ],
      "correct": [0],
      "explanation": "Consolidated billing allows you to consolidate payment for multiple AWS accounts into a single bill. However, Reserved Instance discounts are only shared with the master account that purchased them. The other accounts in the consolidated billing family cannot automatically benefit from the Reserved Instance pricing. This is a key limitation of consolidated billing - while it provides centralized billing and potential volume discounts, Reserved Instance benefits remain with the purchasing account.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "Consolidated billing centralizes payment for multiple AWS accounts",
        "Reserved Instance discounts are only shared with the master account",

        "Secure transfer of large amounts of data into and out of the AWS."
      ],
      "correct": [0, 4],
      "explanation": "AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of AWS. It provides built-in computing capabilities (Snowball Edge) that allow customers to process data locally before transferring it to AWS. This is particularly useful for scenarios where internet connectivity is limited or when you need to process data before uploading. Snowball is not a catalog of third-party software, nor is it a hybrid cloud storage service - it's specifically designed for secure, large-scale data transfer.",

      ],
      "correct": [2],
      "explanation": "IAM user groups allow you to organize IAM users into logical collections and assign permissions to the group rather than to individual users. This makes it much easier to manage permissions for large numbers of users by simply adding or removing users from groups. IAM roles are for granting permissions to AWS services or temporary access, while IAM users are individual accounts. AWS Organizations is for managing multiple AWS accounts, not for organizing users within a single account.",
      "keyPoints": [

        "Dedicated instances.",
        "On-demand instances."
      ],
      "correct": [3],
      "explanation": "On-demand instances are the best choice for short-term, uninterrupted workloads. They provide the highest flexibility with no upfront costs or long-term commitments. Since you need the application to run without interruption for exactly one day, on-demand instances ensure availability. Spot instances could be interrupted, reserved instances require longer commitments, and dedicated instances are for compliance requirements, not short-term usage.",

      "correct": [1, 2],
      "explanation": "Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon EMR are fully managed services where AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, scaling, patching, and maintenance. With DynamoDB, AWS manages the database servers, replication, and scaling. With EMR, AWS manages the Hadoop cluster infrastructure. Amazon VPC, IAM, and EC2 are infrastructure services where customers have more responsibility for management and configuration.",

      "correct": [0, 3],
      "explanation": "Patch Management and Configuration Management are shared controls in the AWS shared responsibility model. AWS is responsible for patching the underlying infrastructure, while customers are responsible for patching their applications and operating systems. Configuration management is also shared - AWS manages the configuration of the cloud infrastructure, while customers manage the configuration of their applications and data.",

      "correct": [0, 1],
      "explanation": "Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling help eliminate single points of failure by distributing traffic across multiple instances and automatically replacing failed instances. ELB provides redundancy by routing traffic to healthy instances, while Auto Scaling ensures that failed instances are automatically replaced and the desired capacity is maintained. This automation helps detect and react to failures without manual intervention.",
